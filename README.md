# IoT- 4 Axis Stepper Motor Controller, 4-5 Amp,  Micro-Stepping , TCP/IP - Modbus Web Server, HTML Pages, Isolated IO's 5-24V, Internal FIFO, 
Isolated  Shaft Encoder Inputs,  Profile-Trapezoidal-Speed-Sequential  Motion Control, Over Current protection and Over Temperature Protection, Only Motor  Power is needed.

ST600µNET can control independently in real time 4 axis trough an USB port, as standard product. 

Motor Current is controlled by an industrial chopper driver, from 0.5 Amp to 4 Amp, for each axis. 

ST600µNET can operate with Biphasic and Unipolar stepper motors, from 0.5 Amp to 4 Amp,  slew rates from 1 step t o20,000 steps/sec. 
Through our patented technology “High Inertia Loads”, the motor can be drive with minimum power consumption at higher torque delivery,
motor performance functions can be enabled in the kernel. This allows the user to keep both power consumption and heat generation to a minimum, 
while the motors are idle, by reducing the winding current.
Smooth motion and higher torque is achievable at high speeds thanks to the velocity profiling mode, 
which allows the creation of custom speed profiles using the internal FIFO on the RMV857 stepper motor controller.
